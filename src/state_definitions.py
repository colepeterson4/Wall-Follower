#Here is where you can define all of your states in a clever way to make your code more readable.
#Think of all the states your robot could be in if thrown randomly into a world.
#Currently the code is set up for a variable name being equal to an integer like:

#FOLLOW_LEFT = 1
#FOLLOW_RIGHT = 2
#TURN_LEFT = 3
#TURN_RIGHT = 4
#WANDERING = 5


#for each of your states.
